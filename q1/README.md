Question 1

Develop a feed forward neural network in python that classifies the images found in the MNIST dataset. You are to train your neural network using backpropagation. You must show that you have:

Performed K-fold cross correlation.
Used weight decay for regularization.
Investigated the performance of your neural network for different (a) numbers of hidden layers and (b) size of hidden layers.
