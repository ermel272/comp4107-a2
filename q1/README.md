Question 1

Develop a feed forward neural network in python that classifies the images found in the MNIST dataset. You are to train your neural network using backpropagation. You must show that you have:

Performed K-fold cross correlation.
Used weight decay for regularization.
Investigated the performance of your neural network for different (a) numbers of hidden layers and (b) size of hidden layers.

# Setup

## Installing Dependencies
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Setting up the environment

```
  mkdir .cache/
```

# Running

```
  python a2-q1.py
```

# Testing
Several trained neural networks have been stored in the assets/ directory. They can be accessed from `interactive-brain.py`

Run `python -i interactive-brain.py` to interact.
