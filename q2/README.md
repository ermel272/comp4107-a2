Question 2

Develop a feed forward RBF neural network in python that classifies the images found in the MNIST dataset. You are to train your neural network using backpropagation. You should use gaussian functions as your radial basis functions. You must show that you have:

Used K-means to design the hidden layer in your network.
Performed K-fold cross correlation.
Investigated the performance of your neural network for different sizes of hidden layer.
